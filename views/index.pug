      p The Vulnerability report will tell you whether there is anything that needs your attention, give you a link to the relevant security advisory, and to top it all off, give you a list of all of the front-end JavaScript frameworks and libraries you depend on. Go ahead, enter your website URL and click on "Test My Page"
